/**
 * This package contains the controller classes of FakeStore.
 * <p>
 * The controller handles the user input, modifies the model, and decides what the view should draw.
 * <p>
 * This package contains {@link fakestore.controller.IRoute}, {@link fakestore.controller.IClickable} and {@link fakestore.controller.ITypeControl}
 * which are the interfaces this controller uses to interact with the environment. As long as a view is implemented conforming to them and their rules
 * the controller should be able to communicate with them.
